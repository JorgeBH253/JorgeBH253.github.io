description: These are some notes on the existence and uniqueness. There is some extra material here and there but the main
focus is the proof of Existence and Uniqueness. Most of these notes come from Folland's Abstract Harmonic Analysis. My primary motivation
for the Haar measure is that it is an essential tool to do probability on more exotic spaces. Moreover, the proof technique 
used here is very useful in other contexts. Some elements of the proof I presented here I have ended up using in problems in Ergodic Theory 
and Probability.

From now on I have decided to simply uplead PDFs as I think this is easier for everyone:
