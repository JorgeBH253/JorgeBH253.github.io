# Hello world!

This is my first post. My name is Jorge Blanco, and I am a UC Berkeley Statistics graduate student studying probability theory. Welcome to my blog!

My goal for this blog is to share cool and interesting things I discover. Expect a lot of expository articles, where I rewrite concepts in my own words to better understand them. If you are studying similar topics, I hope you find these posts helpful.

## So, what content will I be posting?

### Problem Solving

I am a big fan of problem-solving books, especially those focused on Math Olympiads. I didn't have the chance to focus on them earlier, as I only learned about them in college and didn't have much time then. Moving forward, my goal is to solve one baby Olympiad-style problem every day and post my solution on this blog.

### Probability Theory

As mentioned in the introduction, my PhD is in Probability Theory. I plan to write a lot about topics I am curious about, possibly including some of my current projects. We'll see how it goes!

### Analysis

I also love analysis, so I aim to write expository articles on Harmonic Analysis, Complex Analysis, and their connections to Probability Theory.

Stay tuned for more updates!
